## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

In my daily work, I'm using C++, CMake, Conan, and gtest around 80% of the time. But you know what? I've NEVER had an opportunity to set up such a project from scratch. Always I was encountering the ready project 'just to build' or someone else was doing that. It's a shame, so I'm going to do it here. I'm doing it for myself and for everyone who would like to start working in such an environment. 

In my work I was using VS Code with the following plugins:
* C/C++
* C++ Test Mate
* CMake
* CMake Tools
For compilation, I was using Clang 8.0.1.
